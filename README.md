# Portfolio-AMAN

Hi everyone! This is my portfolio website made with **React** and **TypeScript**.  

Please stay tuned as I will be updating it frequently with new projects and features.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – Frontend library
- **TypeScript** – Type safety for JavaScript
- **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn-ui** – UI components library

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/beastspectare-sys/Portfolio-AMAN.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

cd Portfolio-AMAN

3. Install dependencies:

npm install

4. Start the development server:

npm run dev

The website will now be running locally and auto-reload on changes.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on **Netlify** (or your preferred hosting).  
All future updates pushed to GitHub will automatically redeploy the site if connected.
